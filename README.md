# Callback-Functions
Week6: Callback Functions

I. File list
------------
Callback Functions and Arrays - Microsoft Word Document

callbackFunctionExercise - JavaScript File

wordCountExercise - HTML File

sortingNumbersExercise - HTML File


II. Concept
----------
The word document defines callback functions and how they are used in JavaScript and provides some example code. Also covered are more commands for manipulating an Array such as array.forEach, array.Filter and array.sort.

The callbackFunctionExercise JavaScript file allows you to practice the syntax for callback functions using the developer tools in your browser.

The wordCountExercise HTML file allows you to count the words in a paragraph (as a string) and also count each unique word and display those results in the developer tools using the browsers console. You can manipulate the text of the paragraph and add in your own text by modifying the variable let text = " ".  Simply drag and drop the HTML file into an empty browser tab and check the console for the results of the total word count and the unique word count of your string.

The sortingNumbersExercise HTML File takes an array of numbers and provides the code to sort those numbers and output the results in the console provided by the developer tools in your browser.


III. Future Improvements
----------
Nothing at this time.

The source material for this repository contains information and code from the MITxPRO Full Stack Development with MERN 32 week bootcamp course.
As a student in the course, I have participated in reading the course materials and created my own code throughout all of the course projects. As a result I have provided my own additions, comments, material and code to the repositories along the way.
