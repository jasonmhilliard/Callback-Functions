# Callback-Functions
Week6: Callback Functions

I. File list
------------
Callback Functions and Arrays - Microsoft Word Document

arrayManipulationExercise - JavaScript File

fatArrowFunctionExamples - JavaScript File


II. Concept
----------
The word document defines callback functions and how they are used in JavaScript. Also covered are more commands for manipulating an Array.

The arrayManipulationExercise JS file allows you to manipulate arrays in JS using the array.slice and array.splice commands.  You can practice this by using the developer tools in your browser.

The fatArrowFunctionExample JavaScript file allows you to see an alternative method to creating functions in JS using Fat Arrows. You can practice this by using the developer tools in your browser.


III. Future Improvements
----------
Expansion of the arrayManipulationExercise to include other commands such as array.push and array.pop.

The source material for this repository contains information and code from the MITxPRO Full Stack Development with MERN 32 week bootcamp course.
As a student in the course, I have participated in reading the course materials and created my own code throughout all of the course projects. As a result I have provided my own additions, comments, material and code to the repositories along the way.
